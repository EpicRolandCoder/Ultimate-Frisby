# Ultimate-Frisbee
**Overview:**
Each of the three games can be run via the exe file, with the other four files being in the same folder.

**Ultimate Frisbee OG:**
WASD controls the blue square (x to shoot) and the arrow keys control the red square (period to shoot). By touching the frisbee, or touching the opposing player when they have the frisbee, you gain possession of it and can not have it taken off you for a few seconds. The goal is to shoot the frisbee to your similar coloured teammate in your endzone, thus scoring a point.

**Ultimate Frisbee 2 Player Revised:**
Similar to the original version, except the endzone players are controllable. RF for Blue endzone and OL for Red endzone. This adds a bit more control and a bit more skill, compared to the original which relied mostly on luc (although I still personally think that the first game was more fun).

**Ultimate Frisbee 4 Player Edition:**
4 controllable square battle it out on the field this time. WASD(X) and TFGH(C) for the blue squares while IJKL(,) and ArrowKeys(.) for the red squares. Scientifically proven to be the optimal distribution of 4 people on a keyboard (Source: Trust me Bro).
